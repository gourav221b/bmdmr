<p> The global electric vehicles market has taken a humongous step forward in the past few decades. Despite the fact that this market has been growing tremendously with rapid growth in the number of EV's worldwide, industry forecast would suggest that we have just created the map towards creating wonders.</p>

<p>Electric mobility is expanding at a rapid pace. The growing sensitivity towards a hygienic environment demand for zero- emission vehicles. Few nations like UK, Germany, Europe, US are actively taking part and are promoting the use of e- mobility technology which has eventually resulted in the success of electric vehicles market. </p>

<p>The EV market is influenced by globally renowned (BYD) China, (Tesla) USA, (BMW) Germany, (Nissan) Japan, Volkswagen (Germany). These companies brought novel products, initiated collaborations, became a union, worked with partnership in order to hold the grip of the market of electric vehicles. </p>

<p>In the initial days we see this e-mobility technology capturing the market with a rapid speed. In 2017 and 2018 there was a rise in the EV sales which was about 65 percent. In the first quarter of 2018, the customers from Europe bought 195,000 plug-in cars, overall sales figures that the rise in the EV sales was about 42 percent higher than the one from the same period in the previous year. Hence, Europe has seen solid growth in the Electric Vehicles market (EVs).</p>

<p> However, in 2019 the increase in the amount of the EV sales became 2.3 million from 2.1 million for annual growth of just 9 percent. Also,followed by declination of 25 percent in the first quarter of the year 2020. The current scenario is that rapid speed has eventually ceased- or at least temporarily paused.</p>

<p>Inspite of the downfall in sales, the global EV market penetration increased 0.3 percent from 2018 to 2019 becoming total of 2.5 percent. Hence, the future of EVs is expected to lead and with time the purchase amount of these products is becoming cost effective which would eventually capture the market and promisingly affordable to buy.</p>
